# Wanderer

Project for UCU for learning OOP

Wanderer is a game, where you have to walk between rooms, seeking for enemies, items, or other points of interests. The game usually has an end, when you die due to failed fight with a monster, who was stronger than you, or if you weren't prepared right for fight with him. Also, there may be goals to achieve to win the game, but in most of the cases, you just have to win every enemy, and then you get your victory.

## First Version

First version is located in the folder ex5. That is a simple version of game, with 3 rooms and 2 enemies. The file main.py was given me, adn all I had to do is creating file game.py, which contains all classes for normal work of the program. In the file I created 5 classes (2 of them I'm not using in the program): Hero, Room, Friend, Enemy, Item. All methods are created in that way, that main.py is working in the same way, as we can see in file log.txt.

In general, that's not a hard program, that will be expanded in the second version

## Second Version

Second version is much more extinct then the first one. It has enemies and friends, there are level of the hero and even a concert. In general, the basics are the same, but characters and items were realised in different files, so in the main there is only realisation of map, and the main gaming logic.

Here is the list of commands, that are worth to try in the game, as you have to try to win it:

north, south, west or east - sides of world that let you to move between rooms. Which one to use you can see in console, as all neighbouring locations are printed into console.

talk - try to talk with a character. You may find out something for your goal

fight - you can find with someone. But be careful, you have to have good equipment, or you may lose the game

take - if there is something on the ground - take it. It may be useful in future

items - shows all your items and level

help - command to help your friends. That may give you some items for your furhter walkthrough

### The Plot

You are the student of UCU, and you have to pass the exam. But your laptop is in the suitcase with a very old lock, you have to hydrate yourself with something very good and you have to be much more higher level than you are now. That's why you start your journey. You are in the search of items, that will lead you to your goal to have 100 points at the exam. 

The locations are similar to the real world. That is L'viv and locations that every UCU student knows. So try it, and see if you can get to the end.
