# Wanderer

Project for UCU for learning OOP

Wanderer is a game, where you have to walk between rooms, seeking for enemies, items, or other points of interests. The game usually has an end, when you die due to failed fight with a monster, who was stronger than you, or if you weren't prepared right for fight with him. Also, there may be goals to achieve to win the game, but in most of the cases, you just have to win every enemy, and then you get your victory.

## First Version

First version is located in the folder ex5. That is a simple version of game, with 3 rooms and 2 enemies. The file main.py was given me, adn all I had to do is creating file game.py, which contains all classes for normal work of the program. In the file I created 5 classes (2 of them I'm not using in the program): Hero, Room, Friend, Enemy, Item. All methods are created in that way, that main.py is working in the same way, as we can see in file log.txt.

In general, that's not a hard program, that will be expanded in the second version
